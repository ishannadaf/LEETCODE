36. Valid Sudoku
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.
Example 1:
Input: board =
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
 ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
 [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
 ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
 ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: board =
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
 ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
 [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
 ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
 ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]] 
 
Output: false
